<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A soufflé is a light and airy French dish that showcases the magic of eggs. This classic cheese soufflé is a delightful blend of fluffy egg whites and rich, savory cheese, perfect for impressing guests at a dinner party or enjoying as a luxurious brunch[3]. The word soufflé comes from the French verb "to blow up," which perfectly describes how this dish puffs up in the oven, creating a golden, crisp top with a soft, creamy interior[8].</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>Pinch of pepper</li>
  <li>3/4 cup milk (1%)</li>
  <li>4 egg yolks</li>
  <li>2 egg whites</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
  <li>1 cup grated Gruyère cheese (for a cheese soufflé)[3][4]</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C)[4].</li>
  <li>Butter a 4-cup soufflé dish and sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese[3].</li>
  <li>In a medium saucepan, melt butter over low heat. Stir in flour, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture is smooth and bubbly[4].</li>
  <li>Gradually whisk in warm milk and bring to a boil, stirring constantly until the sauce thickens[3].</li>
  <li>Remove from heat and add egg yolks one at a time, stirring well after each addition[3].</li>
  <li>Stir in the grated Gruyère cheese until melted[3].</li>
  <li>In a separate bowl, beat egg whites with cream of tartar until stiff peaks form[3][4].</li>
  <li>Gently fold one-third of the egg whites into the cheese mixture to lighten it, then carefully fold in the remaining whites[3].</li>
  <li>Pour the mixture into the prepared soufflé dish[3].</li>
  <li>Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until puffed and golden brown[3][4].</li>
  <li>Serve immediately, as soufflés begin to fall within minutes of removal from the oven[3].</li>
</ol>
